// to enums that already initialize a subset of members and leave the remaining ones uninitialized, with
// the exception of those that enforce a numerical order by assigning a literal to the first member value.
// In other words, the decorated rule ignores enums that don't initialize any member value or those
// that initialize their first member with a number literal.
