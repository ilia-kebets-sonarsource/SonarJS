/**
 * Detects missing secondary location support for rules using secondary locations.
 *
 * A rule is considered to be using secondary location if its implementation calls at
 * some point `toEncodedMessage` from `linting/eslint/rules/helpers/location.ts`.
 *
 * The idea is to parse and analyze the source code of all rules that are exposed in
 * the module `rules/main.ts`. The analysis relies on an internal rule that checks a
 * few conditions required for secondary locations to correctly be supported:
 *
 * - the rule calls `toEncodedMessage` from `./helpers`,
 * - the rule includes `meta: { schema: [{ enum: ['SONAR_RUNTIME'] }] }` metadata.
 *   SONAR_RUNTIME is available in '@sonar/jsts/linter/parameters'
 *
 * The source code of the exported rules violating these conditions will trigger an
 * issue during analysis.
 *
 * The detection is formalized in the form of a unit test. The rule implementations
 * missing something are collected. The presence of such rules eventually makes the
 * test fail, and the names of the problematical rules are reported.
